# scarf.py

Inspired by the KnitYak Kickstarter, which offers mathematical
scarves whose patterns are algorithmically generated, I
thought it would be good to dust off my old knowledge and
generate the same sort of patterns using Python.  The
patterns are simply printed using ASCII, but the code could
be adapted to output in other forms easily.
